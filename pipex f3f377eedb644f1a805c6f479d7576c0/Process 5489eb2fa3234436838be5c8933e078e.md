## Process :

**A process :  is simply a running application, command, or any other program.**

## `Processes Types:`

`There are two types of process basically,`

- 1 - `Foreground processes` :
    
    `A foreground process is a process that is running in the foreground, meaning it is actively using the terminal or command prompt and accepting input from the user. Foreground processes have the user's full attention and are typically interactive programs such as text editors, shells, and interactive command-line programs.`
    
    `In contrast, a background process is a process that is running in the background, meaning it is not actively using the terminal or command prompt and is not accepting input from the user. Background processes are typically non-interactive programs that run in the background to perform tasks or provide services.`
    
    `On a Unix-like operating system, you can control whether a process runs in the foreground or background by using the fg and bg commands. The fg command brings a background process to the foreground, while the bg command sends a foreground process to the background.`
    

- →`User interactive` :
    
    `In the context of processes, "interactive" refers to a process that is designed to accept input from the user and provide output in real-time. Interactive processes are typically run in the foreground, as they require the user's full attention and input.`
    

- →`Initialized and controlled through a terminal session` :
    
    `*A terminal session is a connection to a terminal emulator, which is a program that allows you to interact with the command line interface (CLI) of an operating system. A terminal session allows you to enter and execute commands, view the output of those commands, and perform tasks on the system.
    
    Terminal sessions can be initialized and controlled through a terminal emulator program, such as xterm, gnome-terminal, or iTerm2. These programs allow you to open a window or tab that is connected to a terminal session, and you can then enter and execute commands in that session.
    
    Terminal sessions can be initialized and controlled in different ways, depending on the operating system and terminal emulator you are using. On Unix-like systems, you can usually start a terminal session by opening a terminal emulator program and then logging in to the system. On Windows, you can start a terminal session by opening a command prompt or PowerShell window.
    
    Once you have initialized a terminal session, you can control it by entering and executing commands. You can also use various control sequences and escape codes to perform tasks such as moving the cursor, clearing the screen, and changing the appearance of text.*`
    

- 2 - `Background processes` :
    
    *`Background processes are processes that are running in the background, meaning they are not actively using the terminal or command prompt and are not accepting input from the user. Background processes are typically non-interactive programs that run in the background to perform tasks or provide services`.*
    

- →`Automatic processes` :
    
    `is a process that runs automatically, without requiring user input or interaction. Automatic processes are typically non-interactive programs that run in the background to perform tasks or provide services.
    
    There are several ways to run processes automatically on a computer. One way is to use a scheduling utility, such as the cron daemon on Unix-like systems or the Task Scheduler on Windows, to schedule the process to run at a specific time or interval.
    
    Another way to run processes automatically is to use a daemon, which is a program that runs in the background and performs a specific task or service. Daemons are often started automatically at boot time and continue to run in the background until the system is shut down.
    
    Automatic processes can be useful because they allow you to schedule tasks or services to run automatically, without requiring manual intervention. This can be helpful if you want to perform tasks or services on a regular basis, such as backing up files or checking for updates`.
    

- →`No need of user level input` :
    
    *`Running processes that do not require user input can be useful because it allows you to automate tasks or services, without requiring manual intervention. This can be helpful if you want to perform tasks or services on a regular basis, such as backing up files or checking for updates`***.**
    

***`KERNEL**  : In the context of computer science, the term "kernel" usually refers to the central part of an operating system that manages resources and controls the interactions between hardware and software. The kernel is responsible for managing the system's memory, processes, and input/output operations, and provides a interface between the operating system and the hardware.

In this sense, the kernel is a special process that runs with the highest privileges on the system, and it is not associated with any user-level process. It is not possible for a user to start or stop the kernel process, as it is a fundamental part of the operating system.

The kernel is typically implemented as a standalone program that runs in a privileged mode of operation, separate from user-level processes. It is responsible for managing the system's resources and enforcing access controls, and it provides the necessary services and interfaces to support the operation of other processes and programs on the system.`*

*`The kernel is the central component of an operating system, and it has a process ID (PID) like any other process running on the system. The PID of the kernel is usually 0. You can see the PID of the kernel by running the **ps** command with the **-p 0**  option.`*

 `**‘”’** **The init** process (deamon process ):  is the first process that is started when the system boots, and it has a process ID (PID) of 1. The **init** process is responsible for starting and managing other system processes, and it remains running until the system is shut down.T he **init** process is the parent of all processes on the system, and it is responsible for cleaning up any orphaned child processes that are left behind when their parent processes die or exit. It is also responsible for performing other system initialization tasks, such as setting the system clock and mounting file systems.`

`Daemons are usually started at boot time and run continuously until the system is shut down. They are usually not associated with a specific terminal or user session and do not have a user interface. Because they run in the background and do not interact with the user directly, they are often referred to as "background processes." **”””`** 

`Every process will be terminated after its execution. ‘***_exit***
’ system call is used to terminate the process. This call will release the process used resources also. When a process is ready to terminate, it lets the kernel know why it is terminating with something called’ **Termination Status’**`

`⇒ Most commonly a status of ‘**0’** means that the process succeeded. However, that’s not enough to completely terminate a process.` 

`A process can terminate or end in a number of ways, depending on the specific circumstances and the operating system being used. Some common ways that a process can terminate include:`

- `Normal termination: This occurs when the process has completed its execution and exits gracefully, returning an exit status to the operating system.`
- `Forced termination: This occurs when the process is terminated prematurely by the operating system or by another process, either due to an error or as a result of a user or system request.`
- `Crash: This occurs when the process encounters an unexpected error or exception and is unable to continue executing.`
- `Kill: This occurs when a process is terminated by a signal sent by the operating system or by another process.`
- `Zombie: This occurs when a process has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because the parent process failed to properly clean up after it.`

$**⇒fork():**$

`Take a case that the parent process dies before its child process completion. In that case, Kernel will know that the child process will not get any “WAIT System Call’ from its parent process, and the child process becomes an orphan and is adopted by the init process, the init process will automatically clean up any orphaned child processes when they exit, but in the meantime, they will continue to run and consume system resources. If the parent process dies without properly cleaning up after its child process, the child process may become a **"zombie process”**`

***`Difference between Zombie, Orphan, and daemon Processes:`***

| $Zombie Process$  | $Orphan Process$ | $Daemon Process$ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A Zombie is a process that has completed its task but still, it shows an entry in a process table. | A child process that remains running even after its parent process is terminated or completed without waiting for the child process execution is called an orphan. | A daemon process is a system-related process always running in the background. |
| Zombie process states always indicated by Z | The orphan process was created unknowingly due to a system crash. | Daemon process state indicated by ? in the field of tty column in the output |
| The zombie process has controlling terminals | Orphan The zombie process has controlling terminals. | The daemon process does not have controlling terminals. |
| The zombie process treated as dead they are not used for system processing | An orphan process is a computer process even after their parent terminates init is become a parent and continue the remaining task. | A program that runs for a long time makes them as a daemon process and runs it in the background. |
| To remove the zombie process execute the kill command. | Terminate the Orphan process use the SIGHUP signal. | Daemon process only when system shutdown. |

<aside>
💡 ***`an orphan process can be a zombie process, but not all zombie processes are necessarily orphan processes. A zombie process is simply a process that has terminated but whose parent has not yet waited for it, while an orphan process is a process that has no parent to wait for it***.`

*`In a computer operating system, a process table (also called a task list or task table) is a data structure that the operating system uses to keep track of the processes that are currently running on the system. The process table typically contains information about each process, such as its process ID (PID), parent process ID (PPID), status, and other details.
The operating system uses the process table to manage and schedule processes, and to keep track of their status and resource usage. The process table is typically implemented as a data structure in the kernel, and it is accessed and updated by the kernel and other system programs as needed.

The process table is an important part of the operating system's process management system, and it is used to support the operation and coordination of processes on the system. It is typically implemented as an array or list, with each entry in the table corresponding to a specific process. The operating system maintains the process table dynamically, adding and removing entries as processes are created and terminated.`*

- ***`→ It is not the role of the operating system or the kernel to clean a main process. Instead, cleaning a main process typically involves identifying and removing any sources of contamination or malfunction that may be causing problems or issues with the process.                                          ![!](../pipex%20f3f377eedb644f1a805c6f479d7576c0.md)BUT It is the responsibility of the parent process to clean up after its child processes when they are finished`***
